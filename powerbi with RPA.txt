I've created a comprehensive RPA automation system that integrates with Power BI to pull hardware inventory reports, create dashboards, and automatically send them to the patch management distribution list. Here's what the system includes:

ðŸ¤– RPA Automation Features:

1. Intelligent RPA Bots:
Power BI Hardware Inventory Automation: Complete workflow from data extraction to distribution
Critical Patch Alert Automation: Real-time monitoring and alerting
Weekly Compliance Report Automation: Scheduled comprehensive reporting

2. Step-by-Step Automation Process:
Connect to Power BI Service (authentication)
Pull Hardware Inventory Report (data extraction)
Refresh Data Sources (ensure latest data)
Generate Dashboard (create interactive visualizations)
Export Dashboard (PDF/Excel formats)
Send to Patch Management DL (automated distribution)
Log Results (audit trail)

3. Real-Time Execution Monitoring:
Live progress tracking for each automation step
Visual progress bars and status indicators
Detailed execution history and audit logs
Success/failure tracking with timestamps

4. Advanced RPA Control Center:
Bot management and configuration
One-click execution of automation workflows
Scheduled automation with customizable frequencies
Real-time system status and health monitoring

5. Enterprise-Grade Features:
Multi-recipient distribution (primary and CC lists)
Multiple export formats (PDF, Excel, Power BI links)
Automated scheduling (daily, weekly, monthly)
Comprehensive execution logging and reporting
The system starts on the RPA Automation tab, showing the complete automated workflow that can pull hardware inventory data from Power BI, create rich dashboards, and automatically distribute them to your patch management team without any manual intervention. The interface provides full visibility into the automation process with beautiful, production-ready design and enterprise functionality.
